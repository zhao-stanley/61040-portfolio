# Domains

1. Rock climbing -> probably the sport I've taken the most seriously. It's a big part of my life, and in particular, training for climbing is something I've always thought about building something for. Specifically involving searching within training boards for climbs set by other people.

2. Food recommendations -> helping people discover new restaurants/cuisines based on preferences, dietary restrictions, and social dining experiences.

3. Listening to music -> listening to music is a big part of my everyday life. Would be interesting to build something that helps create a sense of social togetherness + interactivity from an otherwise independent daily activity.

4. Anti-bots -> bots and webscrapers are becoming more and more common on the internet nowadays, automating many actions and making it hard to detect who a real user is.

- Excluded because it would serve more like a package probably rather than a site

5. Academic collaboration -> making study groups, homework coworking, etc

- Feels like something people keep trying to solve but ultimately people don't adopt it

6. Meal sharing -> excess food swipes

- Very niche, hard to deal with permissions from MIT

7. Health and wellness -> physical activity tracker/social interactions via working out

- Ultimately felt kind of generic

8. Local community events -> discovering and organizing neighborhood activities, meetups

- Hard to adopt in terms of users, wasn't too passionate about it

9. Job Hiring -> finding people for jobs/tasks such as photography, etc

- Also feels hard to adopt in terms of users

10. Tab splitter -> when people go out to eat and have a bill, splitting the paycheck

- Felt too specific

# Problems

## Climbing

1. As mentioned before, probably searching for climbs on training boards set by other people

2. Something related to off the wall training such as finger strength training, could be timers/ability to create programs

3. Maybe a social platform for people to share climbs and specifically how they completed the route/tips and tricks to sending a certain climb

### Stakeholders:

New Climbers -> climbs may be too daunting/intimidated and unsure what to do to complete a problem

Existing Climbers -> pain points with training and connecting with other climbers working on similar problems

Gym owners -> climbing doesn't feel as accessible and social, not as many potential customers converting

### Features

1. Search and filter: the ability to refine search by training board/gym/location for outdoors and find the exact climb you're looking for

2. Media: the ability to upload photos and videos demonstrating how to do the climb and see how other people did it

3. Ratings: a rating system for a climb in terms of how hard or soft it was regarding difficulty and maybe even a safety rating for outdoor climbs

## Food recommendations

1. Some sort of search engine for restuaraunts based on natural language/vibes/other unique and interesting methods for when you aren't sure what you want

2. Maybe something that will allow you to see what restauraunts have walk-in reservations or any last minute open spots that you can spontaneously go to

3. Some sort of social features/platform based on food taste/favorite cuisine, etc

Stakeholders:

Serious Diners -> may need better discovery to find new restauraunts/recommendations

Restauraunts -> may need more reach and publicity especially for smaller/family owned businesses

Casual Diner -> may be struggling to describe what they'd want to eat or try and can't find a restauraunt that would really appeal to them

### Features

1. Local Radar -> show up and coming or hot restuaraunts in your area or within a customizable radius

2. Dine Quick -> show restuaraunts with open reservations within a certain period of time that you can quickly snag at the last moment

3. Restauraunt Tinder -> some sort of dating app-like swiping that helps you discover and save new restuaraunts quickly and easily.

## Listening to music

1. Some sort of social platform for sharing what music you're currently listening to or show live activity of friends

2. Some sort of music taste profiler or fun way to visualize mustic tastes

3. Platform for listening to music at the same time, ie collaborative listening, kind of like "listening rooms" but digital

Stakeholders:

Music listeners -> may be tired of current music and want new recommendations

Music labels -> may need new ideas to better connect audience with their artists

Music artists -> might be looking for ways to promote their music in a way that encourages social interaction -> which in turn may lead to virality.

### Features

1. Music taste visualizer -> some sort of map or customizable page that shows your music taste in an interesting and aesthetic way

2. Listening rooms -> ability to listen and play music together with people over the web, discover new tastes from strangers
